    Final game Due nov. 6th
    Final source code will weigh the most for grading.

    don't collaborate on the main branch
    Make your own branch & communicate with the your team before you merge branches
    "git clone" = "download" | "pull" = "update"
    before pulling, save elsewhere in case of overwriting something important

    If you feel like there is something you need to change when implementing the game.
    Put within discord under Questions channel, and don't do it before you get everyone approval or at least my approval.
