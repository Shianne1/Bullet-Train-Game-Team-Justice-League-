WHAT THE GAME IS AND HOW TO PLAY:

GAME INTRO:
“Welcome to the Bullet Train! You, as an assassin have been assigned a task to
swindle a briefcase and any other intel from the world’s most lethal mafia gang leader.
This train will stop at every station and present a mystery or puzzle that you need
to solve to get back in your train cabin and onto the next station. If for any reason
you fail to solve the challenge or are killed you will lose some of your powers and
travel back a station where you may or may not have to fight a monster to get back
on track. While you are on the train, make sure to explore the cabin and collect any
and everything you can to be prepared for your upcoming challenges.
Be sure to consume a good deal of food and drinks as the mafia gang members are not going to be
easy to battle and their leader is not going to be happy to see you trying to get your
hands on the briefcase. Good Luck!”

ABOUT THE GAME:
The game is a mystery solving/puzzle game that involves the player going through
multiple rooms to clear monsters, get stronger by collecting various gear to make the
player stronger, solving a mystery at all the stations, and eventually killing the final
boss and collecting the suitcase. The player will start at station 1 to begin and must
head to the door that leads out to the station that corresponds to the wagon they’re in.
The player must clear all rooms at the station to be able to go to the next train wagon.
This process will repeat until they finish the last mystery then fight the final boss. The
mysteries are simply just paper file item that players will find in a room that allow
them to progress into the next room. The files include information that pertains to the
mafia gang leader and their evil plans.


GAMEPLAY WISE:
Death:
The checkpoints will be the train wagons, every time a new train wagon is
reach the player will unlock that checkpoint. If a player dies, they will return to the
latest train wagon they unlocked and will lose their progress and will have to redo the
fights and obtain their items again.

Fights:
The fights will be turned based and the player can choose to initiate the fight
or run away from the fight. The player can use their weapon of their choice when
fighting (Fists, knife, katana, pistol, rifle). Upon encountering a monster, the player
will have a choice to fight the monster or running. Fighting will put you into combat
and the player can choose to run whenever they want. Running will send you back to
the previous room.

Inventory:
The player will have a general inventory with all the items they have,
weapons, armor, and healing items. The player can have as many healing items as
possible they want with no limit. When using a healing item, it will -1 from their
stack, stacks cannot go under 0. For weapons, once the katana is obtained it will
replace the knife in their inventory, pistol and rifle are their own object and can both
exist. For armor, the armor will be equipped and change the player’s stats, once
equipped will disappear from the player’s inventory.

Goal:
The player will need to complete all mysteries throughout the stations to be
able to access the final boss and then defeat the boss and win.
