# Bullet Train
  
### Game Intro
“Welcome to the Bullet Train! You, as an assassin, have been assigned a task to
swindle a briefcase and any other intel from the world’s most lethal mafia gang leader.
This train will stop at every station and present a mystery or puzzle that you need
to solve to get back in your train cabin and onto the next station. If for any reason
you fail to solve the challenge or are killed, you will lose some of your powers and
travel back to the checkpoint that you have saved While you are on the train, make sure to explore the cabin and collect
any and everything you can to be prepared for your upcoming challenges.
Be sure to consume a good deal of bandages as the mafia gang members are not going to be
easy to battle and their leader is not going to be happy to see you trying to get your
hands on the briefcase. Good Luck!”


### About the Game
The game is a mystery-solving/puzzle game that involves the player going through
multiple rooms to clear monsters, get stronger by collecting various gear to make the
player stronger, solve a mystery at the mystery rooms, and eventually kill the final
boss and collect the suitcase. The player will start at station 1 and must
head to the door that leads out to the station that corresponds to the wagon they’re in.
The player must clear all rooms at the station to be able to go to the next train wagon. The
mysteries are simply just paper file items that players will find in a room that allows
them to progress into the next room. The files include information that pertains to the
mafia gang leader and their evil plans.


### Death
The checkpoints will be the train wagons, every time a new train wagon is
reach the player will unlock that checkpoint. If a player dies, they will return to the
latest train wagon they unlocked and will lose its progress and will have to redo the
fights and obtain their items again.
